ShortestPathInterface

The ShortestPathInterface algorithm provides an interface for finding the shortest path between two points on a graph.

Performance

To run the ShortestPathInterface algorithm, follow these steps:

1) Enter the code of the ShortestPathInterface interface in the appropriate file of your program.
2) Use the findRoute method, passing the required arguments (start point, destination point, obstacles, map size) as described in the method description.

Dijkstra's algorithm

To run the Dijkstra algorithm, follow these steps:

1) Enter the code of the Dijkstra algorithm implementation in the appropriate file of your program.
2) Create an object of the DijkstraShortestPath class, passing the appropriate graph as a parameter.
3) Use the FindRoute method, passing the required arguments (start point, destination point, obstacles, map size) as described in the method description.

Bellman-Ford algorithm

To run the Bellman-Ford algorithm, follow these steps:

1) Enter the code of the implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm in the appropriate file of your program.
2) Create an object of class BellmanFordShortestPath, passing the appropriate graph as a parameter.
3) Use the FindRoute method, passing the required arguments (start point, destination point, obstacles, map size) as described in the method description.
